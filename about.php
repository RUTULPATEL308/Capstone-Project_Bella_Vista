        <h2>Our Kitchen</h2>
        <p>We make fresh pasta in-house each morning and work with local farms and bakeries for produce and bread. Many dishes rotate with the seasons so we keep things fresh and interesting without overcomplicating the food.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How We Build the Menu</h3>
        <p>Our dishes balance familiar Italian staples with lighter, modern touches. You’ll find risotto and grilled mains alongside seasonal vegetables, bright sauces, and simple desserts.</p>
