        <p>Our kitchen makes fresh pasta daily and grills meats and fish over high heat for a clean, satisfying flavour. We keep the menu compact and change it with the seasons.</p>
        <p>Everything is prepared in-house, from sauces to desserts. The wine list is built around small producers and classic regions.</p>
